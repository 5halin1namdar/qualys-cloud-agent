Qualys Cloud Agents extract and consolidate system configuration, vulnerability
and compliance data and update it continuously within the Qualys Cloud Platform
for further analysis and correlation, thus providing a continuous view of the
security and compliance posture of the global network. 
 The agents are lightweight and designed to have minimal system and network
impact.  
 The Qualys Cloud Agent minimizes the complexity of assessing security of IT
systems, especially devices that are mobile or not always on such as laptops
and virtual systems.
